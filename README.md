# clean-code-community

Knowledge repository for Clean Code Community

The repository is divided in to 3 folders:

- code-examples: Links to sample code can be added here
- meeting-notes: notes from every week's meeting
- resources: Links to useful information such as videos, blogs. It would be good if a summary is also provided along with the links
